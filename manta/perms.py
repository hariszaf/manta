"""
The centrality scores generated from cluster_sparse are tested for their robustness.
The idea behind this test is that random rewiring should, to some extent,
preserve the most central structures of the original graph.
We cannot know which edges are true positives and which ones are false positives,
but we do expect that global network properties are retained despite changes in identified associations.

First, null models are generated from the original graph.
These models are rewired copies: edge degree and connectedness are preserved.
Weight is assigned randomly by sampling with replacement from the original weight scores.
For each of these networks, the diffusion iterations specified in cluster_sparse are repeated
as many times as for the original network. The outcome is then a matrix of diffusion scores.

With these matrices, the bootstrap error can be estimated. This error specifies how variable
the centrality statistic is expected to be. It is used in 1-sided t-tests to determine
whether centrality scores are larger or smaller than the percentile thresholds.

    Diffusion process for generation of scoring matrix.
    The implementation of this process is similar
