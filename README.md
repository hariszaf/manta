# manca

Microbial association network clustering algorithm. Version 0.1.0.

This toolbox is aimed at weighted & undirected microbial networks. It uses a diffusion-based proccess to carry out network clustering & centrality calculations.
Moreover, it can generate a Cytoscape-compatible layout that places taxonomically similar & structurally similar nodes closer together.

This version is still in early alpha and has been tested for Python 3.6.

## Getting Started

To install <i>manca</i>, run:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/ramellose/manca.git
```

To run the script, only two arguments are required:
```
manca -i filepath_to_input_network -o filepath_to_output_network
```

To generate a taxonomically-informed layout and centrality scores, add some flags:
```
manca -i filepath_to_input_network -o filepath_to_output_network -f cyjs --layout --central -tax filepath_to_tax_table
```

Layouts can only be generated for .cyjs network files, which are selected with the flag -f cyjs.

For a complete explanation of all the parameters, run:
```
manca -h
```
